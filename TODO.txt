Suggested Improvements to CBW

	See cbw.log for things that have been done.

- Most terminals can be in both inverse video and graphics mode, but
  the graphics variable format cannot reflect this.
  - need new mode 'B' meaning both.

- Program doesn't handle blocks less than 256 chars, which
  makes it hard to decode very short messages.  -- Hard to fix.

- Add window done proc that can cleanup state before
  a window is replaced.  This would fix the bug in the
  knitting window which causes it to accept the currently
  displayed guess.

- Add a decode block command.
- Make the help window two line tall.
- Add a command that allows guess words from the keyboard
  rather than a file.  -- NO better to build vocabulary files.

- Make the propagate command take a range of destination
  blocks.  E.G. "propagate block 0 to blocks 1 thru 5".

- Make C-U multiply cursor motion commands as in emacs.
- The command "q<retrun>" should expand into a quit, instead
  of typing "q<space><return>".

- Add batch mode that applies a sequence of command to all
  the blocks in a file.
  -- The driver routines do this, so it should be easy.

- Document the statistics file format.
- Write a C program for gathering statistics
  -- The original was written in CLU.

- Add a confirm request to the load command.

- Add a better indicator that the program is busy
  - especially for the knit command.

- Need better explaination on knitting.

- Add an automatic C-T mode to help verify correct characters.
- Add command to identify weak characters in the block
  - i.e., chars that don't deduce anything else.

- Add a save command with a default name that the user can change.
  - It should default to the load file name.

- If 127 out of 128 wires are known, set the 128th.

- Document the zeecode program.

- Add a command to goto a specific block number.
- Need better explaination of the pword command.

- Add command that search a dictionary for a word that will
  fit at a given place.
  - Worry about case and endings.
